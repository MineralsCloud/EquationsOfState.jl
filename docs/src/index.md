# EquationsOfState.jl

!!! note

    Starting from `v2.0.0`, `EquationsOfState.jl` has been rewritten. 
    The former behaviors of `EquationsOfState.jl` (`v1.1.4` and earlier) will be deprecated.
    Please follow the latest documentation.

## Package Features

- Calculate energy, pressure, and bulk modulus of an `EquationOfState` of a specific volume.
- Fit an `EquationOfState` on a series of volumes using least-squares fitting method.
- Fit an `EquationOfState` on a series of volumes linearly.
- Find the corresponding volume on an `EquationOfState` given one of the energy, pressure, and bulk modulus.

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions and types.
